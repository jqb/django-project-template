Django project directory layout.
================================

This is Django project directory layout which I use.

Included:
---------

    - sample Fabric fabfile.py to make deployment painless,
    - basic project templates, with jquery, jquery-ui and classy
      (python-like classes for js) included,
      You can change jquery-ui theme and version of those libraries in settings.py file.

      .. code-block:: python
         # ...
      	 JQUERY_VER = '1.4.3'
	 JQUERY_UI_VER = '1.8.5'
         JQUERY_UI_THEME = 'ui-lightness'
         # JQUERY UI PROVIDES FOLLOWING THEMES:
         # base, black-tie, blitzer, cupertino, dark-hive, dot-luv,
         # eggplant, excite-bike, flick, hot-sneaks, humanity,
         # le-frog, mint-choc, overcast, pepper-grinder, redmond,
         # smoothness, south-street, start, sunny, swanky-purse,
         # trontastic, ui-darkness, ui-lightness, vader


    - django-debug-toolbar included,
    - basic configuration for developement with sqlite3



Concepts:
---------
    - project's (django) applications are in ./project/apps/ directory.
      (git doesn't allow to keep empty directories so you have to create it by hand)
    - it uses jquery at google's ajax: googleapis.com so keep it in mind that
      javaScript won't work without internet connection.



Usage:
------
   1) clone the repository:
      $ git clone https://jqb@github.com/jqb/django-project-template.git

   2) remove version control directory:
      $ rm -rf django-project-template/.git

   3) rename the project directory
      $ mv django-project-template my-cool-project

   4) It should work:
      $ cd my-cool-project/project/ && ./manage.py runserver

   5) Don't forget to change this README file :)



Why?
----
    - because basic django project layout sucks
